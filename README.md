# rethink-activities-button
This Gnome extension converts the activities label into a dynamic workspace indicator.
I found it here: https://gitlab.gnome.org/Teams/Design/os-mockups/-/issues/227
And thought it looked cool, so I'm trying to install it on Nimaos by default! (:

Edit: Well, this is gonna be the default on gnome :))
